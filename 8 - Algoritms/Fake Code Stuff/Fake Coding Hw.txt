Question 1:

a)
output "Question 1"

deanery_value = 15
binary_value = []

b = deanery_value mod 2
deanery_value = (deanery_value - b) / 2

output b
output deanery_value

//

b)
output "Question 1"

denery_value = 256
binary_value = []

loop I from 0 to denery_value
    b = denery_value mod 2
    denery_value = (denery_value - b) / 2
    binary_value += b

output binary_value

//

c)

Question 2:
	A sequence is described by a set of simple rules. Begin with an integer and then repeat, following these rules:
	1 - If the number is even, divide by 2
	2 - If the number is odd, multiply 3 and then add 1
	3 - If the number is 1, then stop

	a) Create a loop which prints out the values of the sequence,
	b) Given that you don’t know how long a sequence will be, storing the values in an array is not feasible. Instead, use a collection (see Names Collection in drop down on the IB compiler page)  to store all the values and then print them out at the end.
	c) Create an array that contains all the numbers in your collection that are multiples of 5. See the Prime Array demo program as an example of creating arrays.
